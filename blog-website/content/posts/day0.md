this is more just to have a first post tbh... but ig ill explain what im gonna doooo and stuff 


## the plan :3

### 1. watch a new movie every week
I've been wanting to watch more movies, but i just never have the motivation / energey / time to do so. and even when I do i usualy just rewatch a movie ive liked from the past

---
so, as part of my yearly goal, im gonna try to watch a movie ive never seen before every week ( i'll still re-watch movies and write about them but the goal is to watch a movie ive never seen before, for every week )

### 2. writing about them
i do enjoy watching movies alot, but i think it would be fun to give my raw opinions of them. idk how long these posts will end up being or whatever but... like idk i think it would be silly and fun, esp to look back upon. I thought about rating them , and maybe i wil leventually but idk i feel like its so hard to find objective criteria since movies are so diferent

### 3. Finding movies   

errr this will be a bit tuff. if you have any movie sugestions **dm me on [insta](https://www.instagram.com/krakenthejaken/) plz** !! if you suggest something theirs like a 95% chance i will watch it !! the way i usauly do it is look on free movie sites ([Tubi](https://tubi.tv/) or [YouTube Movies](https://www.youtube.com/movies), etc...) but i also want to watch movies that i just havent yet / finished (Godfather, kill bill, etc). Not to be like ohh look at me im so niche, but i do rlly enjoy stumbling across movies cus then its like oh wow ! 

### 4. iduno 

overall i just want to have more creative output overall. like this website rn it **SUCKS** but im sure as time goes on i will slowly improve it, ive had ideas for a while but the best way to start something, is to just start it. the best time to start somthhing is yester, but the second best time is now. and ike if i don't try i cant rlly like be upset about it lol

### 5. re-watching

i am also gonna try to re-watch a lot of films to that i've really enjoyed as sort of like documentaion. i remmeber a bit ago i tried finding a cite so i could like list them all (kinda like myanimelist), but i just didn't like how they were formatted, and it seemed pointless, but im hoping this gives me motivation to do so ! 


### 6. other goals

this is more for the website overall but i just want to like, like i said before give more output. ig kinda to the ether but idk. im gonna have a travels section eventualy but i haven't travelled too much. i've thought about mkaing a more like diary section but there's alot of things that i woudn't wnat public  that one would put in a real diary, and my day-to-day life is usualy kinda boring esp when ill have more schooling going on which will distract me .  i think overall i''ll have a fun time doing this. I do enjoy thinking about movies and spamming ppl with my thoughts, but thinking them mroe out into mini (alibet definitly also rambly like this one) will be super fun. For a project i analyzed Black Swan, which i could write many things about, but like not coherently, which i thnk somethign like this would be great for.

---
eventauly ill prolly go back and add more links to movies i mentioned but for now, while my udnerstanding of how markdown ( the language these posts are written in ) is rlly bad, that will be all for now. fyi i'll try to tag posts appropiatly so hopefully if you're looking for a specific movie later in the line, you'll be able to find it. Conincal (weekly movies) will be tagged with somethign like "weekly movie", whereas if im just watching something for fun it will be given a diff tag. anyway bye \<3

## tldr
every week i'll be watching a new movie, if you have any suggestions plz reach out i'd love to hear it \:) if not i hope you enjoy my rambles, im trying to see the world in a pawstive view, i hope i can bring happines to all those who care enough to read my random thoughts and opinions. I hope you. Yes you the reader. are having a fantastic day.
