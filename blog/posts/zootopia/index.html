        <p>my goal is to watch a new movie every week, and the film i chose was Zootopia 2. i will talk more about my choice in it&rsquo;s actual page but yeah :) in order to get ready for it (i&rsquo;m gonna see it at 10pm, i think the movie might either end a couple mins before midnight or slighlty after technicly failing my goal but like, is anyone even reading these? i hope so / eventauly ppl will. Im hoping  a few specific people i have in mind atleast read them occasionly&hellip; I do rant alot i feel but like idk, i want to be unabridged)</p>
<h1 id="the-begining">the begining</h1>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t watched this film in quite sometime and, though this can be said for a lot of the moive, i was <strong>SHOCKED</strong> by how like the word isn&rsquo;t scary cus i wasn&rsquo;t rlly scared ( and also cus i remembered the plot ) but like scary like if i was a young child some scenes were genuinily frightning !!
I really enjoyed the guy doing the music for the play, like you would see in like, ig its not a silent film but the little bands they would have at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film#Live_music_and_other_sound_accompaniment">old movies</a>. I say old like i would&rsquo;ve seen them lol&hellip; anywho &hellip;</p>
<h1 id="slighlty-sad-tangent-about-my-youth">slighlty sad tangent about my youth</h1>
<p>this movie came out march 4th 2016, over 10 years ago i wouldve been 9 when this came out. I barley remember anything from my past. Even events a few years ago seem foggy to me, why? no clue i don&rsquo;t enjoy it. But one common motif I remember from my childhood, is like not to say I didn&rsquo;t have one, or whatever I had a great one but whatever I enjoyed i had a voice in the back of head telling me <strong>&quot; you are too old for this everyone is going to hate you. It&rsquo;s so weird to enjoy this you should just not watch it at all&quot;</strong> This was a common thing I felt when watching Wizards of Waverly Place, a show I really liked, to the point of me having a tick? (not sure the propper terminolgy + it was so long ago i don&rsquo;t really remember the specifics of it tbh), of having to complete the hat song whenver I heard the word &lsquo;hat&rsquo;  ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_gVb3z6vtc">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? A hat? Crazy funky junky hat! Overslept, hair unsightly, trying to look like Kiera Knightley. We been there, we done that, we see right through your funky hat!&rdquo;</a>). I did this at a summer camp i attended and the counsler, also a fan of the show joined me and I felt so ashamed of myself.  I hated these thoughts so much i just felt like for any peice of media i would consume, this nagging voice would always acompany. That is part of why in my curent era ( or phase if you will ), im trying not to channel my inner child or whatever, cus like i don&rsquo;t watch kids shows or whatever, but to try to be more unapolgeticaly into the things i am. idk. This emotion also would happen whenever I watched more &lsquo;kids&rsquo; movies, even when I was younger my dad took me to see Pixels when it released (about a year before this) , and like yeah its an Adam Sandler movie so&hellip; lowkey i shouldve been a bit embarrased but i still rlly enjoyed it ! I saw an edit of pixels the other day which caught me off gaurd it had  the ben 10 theme song playing in the background.  I feel ike alot of the media i consumed as a child i gave up in fear of being weird, even when I would <em>purpsefully</em> only watch things when I knew no one would be around. idk. kinda still to this day I dislike being percieved&hellip;</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think that my overall long (and still lasting) feeling of self-hatred are partly to blame. growing up I know people made fun of me behind my back, but I don&rsquo;t rmemeber it really effecting me. Sure i didn&rsquo;t enjoy it but my coping strategy at that time was to be gross/bad on purpose to push people away from me. I don&rsquo;t like that choice I made but it was one i did ( as in, push away the haters, i did have one close friend growing up )&hellip; but I can only think of two times people did so in front of me. One is a person who I won&rsquo;t name but in grade school, and tbf this is a hunch, would always say they liked (romanticly) me. It wasn&rsquo;t like we were friends or anyhting, and though now I can&rsquo;t accuratly analyze the social dynamics we had, I was certain then she was doing it in a way to try and make fun of me. The only other time I recall being made fun of was when I was walking slow in the hall to my class (when they made you all walk together) these three girls behind me were saying things like &ldquo;oh my god can you move faster&rdquo; or something like that, which tbf i was probably going a bit slow. I rebutted &ldquo;oh im just saving energy for field day&rdquo;, something even then I was like why did I say that, but i didn&rsquo;t want to be made fun of. I really don&rsquo;t like being perceived by people i don&rsquo;t know. Even those who i know super closely i still mask many things about  myself, with only a few, maybe 2 people ever have I totaly unmasked in front of. Obviosuly some masking is necessary to be in public but i&rsquo;ve been actively trying to mask less, at least in scenarios i can be. Does this make less people like me? probably, i could write about my thoughts over college but i don&rsquo;t want that to be public LOL. I still deeply hate myself, which i am trying to work on, it&rsquo;s just hard to do, especially in boston for a multitude of reasons&hellip;</p>
<p>too get back to the point.. consideirng my other thoughts, i do wonder what my opinions of this movie were when i first watched it. like I said before I remembered almost all of the plot points (ill talk about the one I didn&rsquo;t a bit later),  to like a suprising degree. Again i don&rsquo;t rememberr details of only a few years ago, but i still rememberd a ton of this movie, that cant be said with every movie i&rsquo;ve rewatched most of which ill eventaly do posts about. A good example would be codewars, which was a movie I watched, I don&rsquo;t recall but probably some time during the pandemic? I really enjoyed it! and of course I remembered some of the plot points but not all (bo!!!)</p>
<h1 id="trasnportaion">trasnportaion</h1>
<p>tbh everytime a differnt mode of transportation appeared i was like <strong>whoaoaaoaoah!!!!</strong> it distracted me from the film. Bunnyburrow is 211 miles away from Zootopia. about the Distance from to New York, or Philly to Pittsburgh. When she leaves town after getting accepted into the ZPD, we learn that Bunnyburrow has a population of 81 million ~  which was a fun thing to see I like population numbers and other data like that. the train ride into the city was very enteratingin to see. I liked how it introduced the four&hellip; Districts of zootpia and the various architechtures they had around (Luxory, oasis palm tree hotel?) Tundratown etc&hellip; All leading into the central train station where there appear to only be 2 tracks. I enjoyed the very round-about way the tain took into the city instead of sum direct path i found it very entertaining.
The little rodentia section was also cool with the ( relatively ) minuatre trains they had runing around. Reminds me of a movie i havent seen (yet?) the downsizing where they just shrink u so its like cheaper. I do enjoy the various infrastructers between different animals (i.e the tubes for the little rodents to go thru) was also cool to me. The entire movie is about the devide between prey and predator like cohesting so its intresting to see what accesibility things they do have.
I dont know enough about cable cars to appriciate them during the rainforrest section.  I do know that they are crazy good in places like Medellín, and other Sotu American countires.
The subway!! they have a subway and judy like blows it up LOL!</p>
<h1 id="sparatic-thoughts-about-the-movie-in-a-vague-order">sparatic thoughts about the movie in a vague order</h1>
<p>I like how the movie is setting up like judy wanting to be more invovled in the police force instead of just being assinged for Traffic duty but like this is her FIRST day and like im not saying that she isn&rsquo;t being unfairly trated due to being a bunny but like, especialy with all the destruction she causes later&hellip; idk when watching i was like, Judy&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the Nick Wilde popsicle scheme lots of times on various social medias ove the years, but i do enjoy the attention to detail they have throuhogut</p>
<p>Whenver we see an animal effected by nighthowerls its so genunily terrifying!! again like i said earlier i didn&rsquo;t remember being frigthend by this film but its so scary! like normally naimals wlak on 4 legs except a couple (Jebora&hellip;.) but like in this movie they made the reasonalbe choie not to do that.. and like when manchas goes &lsquo;savage&rsquo; its so genuinly terrifying like holy!!!</p>
<p>despite her inexperience I felt like the scene where judy gives the press confrence too felt kinda out of character. like sure she hasn&rsquo;t done this before, im not saying I wouldn&rsquo;t make the same mistakes, i don&rsquo;t think i would but like i havent had to give a presention in that little time and that scale !! but like idk&hellip; I really feel like she grew and</p>

<p>Not really that notablee tbh but i alluded to it earlier so im mentioning it again.. the nudist scene. Judy and Nick are trying to get more information on the where abouts of Emmit Otterton and wind up at the Mystic Spring Oasis, a nudist colony. I did not recall this scene at all when re-watching it.</p>
<h1 id="the-bad">the bad?</h1>
<p>I mean like the common complaint everyone has is the villian. And tbf on an objective stand point it was kinda shoehorend in but like i really enjoy teh scene of them being down in the enclouser, it&rsquo;s always been kinda ingrained in my head since hte first time i watched it. I coulnd&rsquo;t really tell you why but yeah! Im kinda easy to please, i can watch a bad movie and just enjoy it cus that&rsquo;s kinda what I try to do in life. One time during freshman year of college I was on a train somehwere, I don&rsquo;t remember exaclty where maybe TacoBell or somthing like that, but the train got stuck in between two stations. This often happens in my experince with the MBTA, but never to obad. This time though was pretty bad. We were stopped, in a hot tunnel, for liek 40 minutes and it was super late at night. I think it is very reasonalbe to be upset by this. I never try to tell anyone they are overreacting (even if they are, cus telling someone that won&rsquo;t help the situation + you are not them. to you they are overreacting, but to them they arent! I can&rsquo;t imagine the thigns many people go thru, there struggles and tribulations so it&rsquo;s really not my place to tell anyone this), but like i don&rsquo;t think it would be an over-reaction at all to compalin about this. But for me. And I&rsquo;m really not trying to get on a high-horse here and be like wow look at me i don&rsquo;t ever compalin. I do alot&hellip; but like I try to find joy in the experince and in like just being present. <strong>The time will pass anyway</strong> is one of my favorite quotes. It can be applied to alot of things, but I try to apply it to life. When I don&rsquo;t have too i really don&rsquo;t want to spend too much energy dwelling on things. I already do alot, with regerts in my life. Things I hope will happen. Things i want to happen but i know never will, etc&hellip; and I just want to be happy. I can find joy in talking to friends on the train about the absurdity of the situation, I can find joy in knowing this is a unique experince. Sure right now im sweating and hot but in like a week, that sweat will have been washed away. The antagonist might of been poorely introduced, bad motives, and so little screentime being the villian, but it still gave me an everlasting image, that I hold dearly.</p>
<h1 id="things-i-enjoyed-but-i-put-in-no-section">things i enjoyed but i put in no section</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I really nejoy how supportive Judy&rsquo;s roomates are so supportive of her and they claimed to be loud but like bairly ever are!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I find it humerous how destructive Judy and Nick are like they are causing so much property damage and other reckless endagerments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at the DMV, though like in the movie it takes them <strong>FOREVER</strong> to run the plate, they don&rsquo;t really make it seem like that which i found humerous like&hellip;  they can&rsquo;t really spend too much time there in the movie for like obvious reasons like they cant make it actualy take forever but like flash told one joke and apart from that just did his actual job :sob:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like how gazelle does activism</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like how they just aid and abet the mob, when we know like he does kill (ice) people&hellip; like fair enough you are police !!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="end-all">end all</h1>
<p>I would analyze the themes in this movie a bit like at all, isntead of just being a random collection of things I enjoyed about it but like idk. I don&rsquo;t want to do it an injustice by having a section about it if im not gonna fully take time to analyze it, but i also don&rsquo;t want to spend 10 hours properly researching it. If i had to for a class or somthing i would enjoy the experince its a good movie! but idk&hellip; That is an exercise for you to do&hellip;</p>
<p>P.S.
( in the future I would like to, for one, make these more gramtically correct, and thought out. I can&rsquo;t really take notes during a movie at the theatre but when watching at home/dorm i can more easily which i think will be better. I could&rsquo;ve done it for this too, but i watched this only an hour before I was seeing the next so yeah.. I&rsquo;d also like to include screencaps and such later too&hellip; )</p>
